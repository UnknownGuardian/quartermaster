/**
 * 
 * Examine what parts of the system we want to represent.
 * 
 * Github Push hook = one event. They started with none, then had "several 
 * multiples of our normal peak" traffic.
 * 
 * GithubHookReciever = entry point
 * Some retry strategy
 * A failing database
 * 
 * Described flow from incident report:
 * 1. Github sends events to CircleCI via push hooks
 * 2. The events are queued in the build queue.
 * 3. On enqueue, write to DB (? unclear)
 * 4. On dequeue, database is queried for info on customer plans, container 
 *      allocation, etc. Also likely that the work to be done is writen to the DB.
 * 5. On success, start work.
 * 6. On Fail
 * 
 * 
 * Properties:
 * - The build queue is not bounded
 * - The build queue is complex priority queue
 * - Degradation occured within 2 minutes
 * - Dequeue started slowing down to 1 per minute (instead of many per second)
 * - Queries take lots of time to run
 * - Many Queries time out (not sure if this is a timeout on the query side or 
 *      API layer)
 * 
 * Unknowns:
 * - Usage queue (builds sit here when customer doesn't have enough capacity)
 * - Run Queue (builds sit here waiting for system capacity)
 * 
 * 
 * Their course of action:
 * - Want to salvage queue and still process builds. However, they know value
 *   of the queued items is decreasing so they figure they can purge queue.
 *   They can't just drop data (likely because they have complex software), so
 *   they need a way to unlock DB to rewrite parts.
 * - Stop new builds from joining the queue through load balancer.
 * - Swap in some new build scheduling infra (probably workers
 * - Step down DB, promote secondary (which was overhwlmed)
 * - Turn off automatic re-enqueueing on infrastructure failures (like 500s?)
 * -
